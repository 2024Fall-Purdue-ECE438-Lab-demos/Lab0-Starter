# Lab 0: Python Tutorial

## Getting Started
Python is an excellent general-purpose programming language that, with the help of popular libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing. Compared to traditional MATLAB, Python offers similar data processing and analysis capabilities, with a broader range of libraries and tools, making it increasingly popular in research and engineering applications.

In the field of signal and image processing, Python boasts numerous powerful libraries. NumPy and SciPy provide efficient numerical computation functions; Matplotlib is used for plotting and visualization; and specialized libraries like OpenCV and scikit-image facilitate image processing tasks such as filtering, transformation, analysis, enhancement, segmentation, and feature extraction.

We expect many of you to have some experience with Python and NumPy; for those who donâ€™t, this section will serve as a quick crash course on Python programming and scientific computing. For those with a MATLAB background, we recommend the NumPy for MATLAB users page, which will help you quickly grasp NumPy usage.

In this tutorial, we will cover:

Basic Python: Basic data types (Containers, Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples), Functions, Classes
Numpy: Arrays, Array indexing, Datatypes, Array math, Broadcasting
Matplotlib: Plotting, Subplots, Images
